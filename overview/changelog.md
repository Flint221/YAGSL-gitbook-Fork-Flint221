All PR's should be based off of and merged into here. YAGSL is propagated often to the other repositories.

## 2024.4.7

* [ ] Modules will stay in the previous position if the desired velocity is 0.
* [ ] Cosine compensation is now reported through telemetry as expected.

## 2024.4.6.3

* [ ] Updated heading correction to use `getOdometryHeading()` instead of `getYaw()` (PR [#150](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/150) by [@Blargleflakes](https://github.com/Blargleflakes)) This does impact heading correction PID values in `controllerproperties.json` and may NEED these value's increased by 50x.
* [ ] Added ability to disable the cosine compensator via config files. (PR [#148](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/148) by [@fovea1959](https://github.com/fovea1959))
* [ ] Added `SwerveDrive.getGyro()` to return `SwerveIMU`.
* [ ] Added `SwerveMotor.setVoltage` and `SwerveMotor.getVoltage` and `SwerveMotor.getAppliledOutput` to the `SwerveMotor` wrapper for future use with SysId.
* [ ] Added functions to test setting voltage of all swerve module motor.
* [ ] Added function to find coupling ratio of all swerve modules.
* [ ] Added function to set steering/azimuth/angle using of all swerve modules.
* [ ] Added function to find kV for drive motors to move.
* [ ] Set the angle motor relative encoder position AFTER changing the conversion factor. (Issue [#155](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/issues/155))
* [ ] Fixed module open loop control by sending `maxSpeed` to the module. (by @nstrike and [@MarshallTappen](https://github.com/MarshallTappen))
* [ ] Fixed Pigeon2Swerve only using X acceleration (PR [#146](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/146#event-11577147896) by [@dezash123](https://github.com/dezash123))
* [ ] Prevent drive motors from moving when `absoluteEncoderOffset` is not tuned. (Found by [@fovea1959](https://github.com/fovea1959))
* [ ] Updated javadocs for `SwerveDrive.addVisionMeasurement` so that they reflect the latest changes.

## 2024.4.6.1

* [ ] Fixed `SwerveDrive.resetOdometry` and utilize the pose estimation instead. (PR [#142](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/142) by [@MarshallTappen](https://github.com/MarshallTappen) and @nstrike [commit](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/commit/039e5c2867690cfdd5ebd0c1e84eefc6b165adee))
* [ ] Functionalize IMU inversion (PR [#140](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/140) by [@TechnologyMan00](https://github.com/Technologyman00) and @nstrike)
* [ ] Added `SwerveDrive.getOdometryHeading()`
* [ ] Fixed `SwerveDrive.addVisionMeasurement` with vision standard deviations.
* [ ] Added IMU readings to SmartDashboard via `Raw IMU Yaw` (gyro with invert applied) and `Adjusted IMU Yaw` (pose estimation rotation).
* [ ] Changed `navx_mxp` to `navx_mxp_serial` to notate that it's serial over MXP.
* [ ] Added warning when using `navx_mxp_serial` or `navx_usb`.
* [ ] Added back wheel speed desaturation.

## 2024.4.6

* [ ] Simplified `SwerveMath.calculateDegreesPerRotation` and `SwerveMath.calculateMetersPerRotation` to exclude encoder resolution and add a default.
* [ ] Changed `Module[...] Raw Motor Encoder` to `Module[...] Raw Angle Encoder`.
* [ ] Added `Module[...] Raw Drive Encoder`

## 2024.4.5

* [ ] Fix for TalonFX Angle motor control (by [@bhall-ctre](https://github.com/bhall-ctre), and @Wackyvert 2225 Mentor) .
  1. TalonFX's needed to use conversion factor as gear ratio rather than gear ratio + unit conversion.&#x20;
  2. Conversion factor needed to be inverted.
  3. setPosition update to reflect current position.
* [ ] Changed `ma3` encoders to be read via analog input. (Discovered by [@CoZm0](https://github.com/CoZ-m0))
* [ ] Support 3 wheel swerve module setups with PathPlanner helper function. (PR #139 by [@TechnologyMan00](https://github.com/Technologyman00))
* [ ] Added `SwerveModule.getAbsoluteEncoder()` `SwerveDrive.getMaximumVelocity()` and `SwerveDrive.getMaximumAngularVelocity()`.
* [ ] Reccommend Tuner X when a compatible Tuner X config is used.
* [ ] Added ability to change heading correction deadband.

## 2024.4.2

* [ ] Added feedforward to SparkMAX's.
* [ ] Added Network Alerts (made by[ @TheGamer1002](https://github.com/TheGamer1002) PR [#136](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/136))
* [ ] Added feedforward to TalonFX's
* [ ] Fixed TalonFX conversion factor (made by [@jkbo6](https://github.com/jbko6) PR [#128](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/128))
* [ ] CanAndCoder tweaks (made by [@guineahawk](https://github.com/guineawheek) PR [#134](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/134))
* [ ] Added missing SparkMAX status frame's (made by [@RoboPenguin7](https://github.com/RoboPenguin7) PR [#130](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/130))
* [ ] Heading Correction update to make it less sensitive (made by [@balien-12](https://github.com/balien-12) PR [#132](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/132))
* [ ] Fixed cosine compensator error (made by [@jkbo6](https://github.com/jbko6) PR [#129](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/129))
* [ ] Updated PathPlanner path based off of alliance (made by [@MarshalTappen](https://github.com/MarshallTappen) PR [#122](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/122))
* [ ] Fixed Rotation being off, update getDriveBaseMeters (made by [@TechnologyMan00](https://github.com/Technologyman00))
